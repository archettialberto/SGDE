# SGDE API

The Secure Generative Data Exchange (SGDE) API is a Python API that allows users to upload and download generative models to and from a server.
Models are stored in ONNX format and can be downloaded by any SGDE user. Users can register to the API by providing a unique username, email, and password and upload their own models.

The SGDE API is built on top of FastAPI and uses SQLAlchemy to manage the database. Objects are exchanged using Pydantic models.

For more information about SGDE, please refer to the [SGDE Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12062).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation with docker-compose

To install the API, you can run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment variables

Before running the API, you need to set the following environment variables:

| Name             | Description                          | Default value                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`     | Secret used to sign JWT tokens       | _Unspecified_                    |
| `INSTANCE_PATH`  | Path to the database instance folder | `/instance  `                    |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | Database URL                         | `sqlite:////instance/sgde_db.db` |
| `GENERATOR_PATH` | Path to the generator folder         | `/instance/generators`           |
| `PORT`           | Port to run the server on            | `8000`                           |

You can add these variables to a `.api.env` file in the root folder of the project.

## üèéÔ∏è Running the API with docker-compose

To run the API, you can run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the API, you can run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
